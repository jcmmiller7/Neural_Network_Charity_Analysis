# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview: The purpose of this machine learning and neural network project is to use features within the dataset to create a bianry classifier that is capable of prediction whether or not an applicant will be successful if they are funded by Alphabet Soup. The dataset contains over 34000 organizations with Alphabet Soup funding containing metadata for each organization such as organization type and use of funding. There are three main steps associated with this project. These include preparing the neural network data, compiling/training/analyzing the machine learning model, and model optimization. 


## Results: The model target variable is the "IS_SUCCESSFUL" column.
